These parts are designed to fit the Feetech servos, which seem to be 3mm deeper than the servos used in the stock Chica build.

This multipart coxa allows for the use of a 5x11x4mm bearing on the servo back pieces, as well as providing more material for the M1.6 screws to thread into from the servo horn. The strut attaches with M3 socket head cap screws.
